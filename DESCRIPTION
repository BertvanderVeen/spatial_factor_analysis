Title: Package for implementing spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial analogue of conventional factor analysis
Version: 1.0
Date: 2014-10-30
Author: James Thorson
Maintainer: James Thorson <James.Thorson@noaa.gov>
Description: This package implements spatial factor analysis, which replaces factors with Gaussian random fields.  SFA provides a parsimonious (rank-reduced) model for spatial variation of multiple measures, e.g., species densities.

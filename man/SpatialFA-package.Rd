\title{
Package for implementing spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial analogue of conventional factor analysis
}
\description{
This package implements spatial factor analysis, which replaces factors with Gaussian random fields.  SFA provides a parsimonious (rank-reduced) model for spatial variation of multiple measures, e.g., species densities.
